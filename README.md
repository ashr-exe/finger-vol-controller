# finger-vol-controller
This project uses OpenCV, Mediapipe, and PyAutoGUI to control the system volume based on hand gestures detected via webcam. The script tracks hand landmarks and calculates the distance between the thumb and index finger to adjust the volume. When the distance is above a certain threshold, the volume increases, and when below, it decreases.
